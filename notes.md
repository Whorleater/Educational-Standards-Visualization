# Misc notes from doing this project
- There's a huge number of nodes for each crosswalk, it's probably best to do some kind of expanding visualization with nodes
- Choose root nodes, the system displays based on the crosswalks of the nodes. 
- See [draft](draft.sketch) or [example](http://projects.flowingdata.com/tut/interactive_network_demo/)
- [Tree example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083), [flat array tree example](http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/8329404)
- Two opposing trees implementing the [Reingold-Tilford](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339184) algorithm, having sankey-esque connections
